* The F2 Menu now detects PGD Connected accounts and will no longer show the option to PGD Connect to already connected users
* No more scary scientific notion when performing /checkstats or using the F2 menu to view player experience

* Removed a few erraneous exec calls to non-existent files in the mod load script
* Fixed a bug when users reached an EXP value over 1,000,000 that would cause all of the EXP to be processed additionally from 1,000,000
  * For example, let's say I was 900,001 and gained 100,000 EXP, I would be placed at 1,100,000 instead of the correct value of 1,000,001

* Cleaned up the player kill logic and moved all TWM2 specific damage and death functioning to a separate file
* Addressed the bug preventing the challenges for reaching officer ranks from completing
* Addressed a bug in which vehicle bosses were not recording damage from players to the boss system correctly

    * Now immune to death by falling under the map
	  * Sorry TWM1 Vets, but this strategy is no longer going to work ;)
