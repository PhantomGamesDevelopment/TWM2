## Tribes 2
### Release Version: 3.8
#### [[PREV RELEASE]](3.7.md) | [[NEXT RELEASE]](3.9.md)
* Addressed a problem in the TCPQueryList that would cause some transfers to deadlock and never complete
* Did some prep work for some special zombie related missions.
* Did some serious balancing work on Mr. Trolololol Shade Lord
* Fixed some UE Problems related to Lord Vardison, General Vegenor, and Lord Insignia
* Gave Vardison (and his DA counterpart) a brand new evil hyper laser attack
* Gave The Final Vardison Form a missile spam attack
* Balanced out pretty much all of the weapons to a point that now seems reasonable
* Added extremely challenging Bronze, Silver, Gold, and Titan commendation challenges to every weapon that grant loads of EXP. 
  * These will be for your players who are loyal to certain guns. :)
* Upgraded the Horde Spawning System to cause some less UE problems and added error checks to pretty much prevent Horde from causing UEs anymore.
* Added a few new Hellclasses to Helljump
* Removed the old Hellclasses that used the gravity weapons removed in V2.5
* Pretty much wrapped everything else up, official mod support at this point is dropped...
