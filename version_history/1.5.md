#### [[PREV RELEASE]](1.4.md) | [[NEXT RELEASE]](1.6.md)
* Hell-Jump Game Mode
  * One-life per player
  * Endless survival mode with limited equip, no vehicles, and drop pod action
* Added the ability to set zombie variant names in a control script
* Fixed an error in the $Server::HostGUID setup function
* There were other bugs that were squashed in 1.5, but being such an older time, I did not practice good documentation then, and these were left undocummented.
* Online Services now point to PGD.com (www.phantomgamesdevelopment.com)
  * On a side note, this was actually our domain back then... funny how I thought a long name was good ;)
