# Total Warfare Mod 2
## Tribes 2
### Release Version: 3.1
#### [[PREV RELEASE]](3.0.md) | [[NEXT RELEASE (NOTE: 3.2 / 3.3 were completely undoccumented)]](3.4.md)
* New Vehicle
  * Sandstorm MRLS Tank
    * Advanced anti-vehicle tank armed with a quad rocket pod
* A Few undocmented fixes addressed
  * Note: I went into a pretty bad coding practice period here where I went all in on a bunch of the mod's bigger issues, but I did not document my changes for two releases.
  * For 3.2 and 3.3, these were essentially bug fix versions with no new content additions.
  * The only big "news piece" was in 3.2, where we reset all ranks in the mod to zero, and introduced the beginning of the daily exp cap system as well as an officer cap system
    * These were finished in 3.4 (See next release)
    * To this day, I still don't remember why we did this... but we did...
